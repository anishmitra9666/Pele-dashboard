# Pele-dashboard
# Raw data and dashboard for Brazilian football legend Pele.
# Key insights:-
# 1) Besides Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Pele are head and shoulders above the rest in terms of their individual contributions as players to football with 7 ballon d'ors each by France Football's revised winners.
# 2) Pele is the 5th highest goalscorer in football history with 767 goals and also tied 5th in world cups with 12 goals at the world cup finals alone.
# 3) By the line graphs which show Pele's goalscoring by year, we can clearly see he peaked early and his prime was 1957-1966 from ages 17 to 26 but he did still win the 1970 FIFA world cup well past his best.
